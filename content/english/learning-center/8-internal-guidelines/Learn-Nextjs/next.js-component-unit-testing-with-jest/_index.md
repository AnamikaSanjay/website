So you created an application, everything looks perfect all that is left to do is release it into the market right!? but what if something does not work after the release? To avoid such things testing our applications is important. When I say testing, I basically mean an evaluation for your system. While testing your front-end application your main focus is always the people using your product and also developers. A good test should act as a bridge between both of them. Testing your applications is always a mandatory step before delivery and as the demand for newer applications increases, the demand for automation testing increases too. One of such automation testing tool is Cypress. Cypress is mainly used for `web integration` and `End to End UI automation testing`. In this blog we'll be using cypress for component testing along with its installation and how to use it in your project.

## What is Cypress?
Now, Cypress is a modern front-end testing tool built on Node.js and uses JavaScript for writing end-to-end and component tests. 
- Delivers reliable, fast and consistent tests due to its architectural designs.
- Has the ability to test edge test cases by mocking the server requests.

#### Cypress Component Testing vs Cypress End-to-End Testing
Cypress component testing provides a workbench for your component and lets you build test components from multiple front-end UI libraries. It's browser based test runner allows you to not only check your components functionality but also its styles and the way it looks, you can see and interact with it too.

### Component Testing
Component testing is a software testing type where you can test each individual component seperately without disturbing other components. Here, a component is nothing but a JavaScript function that accepts parameters and HTML and CSS outputs. This allows you to validate each component behaviour at much lower levels.   

### End-to-End Testing
End-to-end testing or E2E testing as its name suggests is to ensure that your application is running as intended and this is done by running tests that are similar to the real-world scenarios and use cases from start to end. IT ensures efficiency of the whole applications, tests the business logic of your application.
