Unit Testing is mainly focused on testing every individual components called units. This allows us to ensure that all components code work as expected in all scenarios.

### What is a Unit Test case?
- Small, self-contained piece of code - to test a specific unit(component) for functionality.
- can be : Functions, Methods, Classes or even small components depending on the software.
Every unit test includes:
1. Providing conditions to test components.
2. Executing functionality of units.
3. Checking component behaviour against expected results.

### Why do we need unit testing?
Unit testing helps in many ways but mainly for:
- Early detection of isses
- Improving code quality
- Faster debugging
- Documentation
- Continuous integration
- Improving software design

### Codium - writing unit test cases with codium
